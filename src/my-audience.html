			<h2> Designers
			</h2>
			<p>Visual Designers. UX Designers. UI Designers. Interaction Designers. Web Designers… (you get the idea). Designers can
				use tools provided by the atom project to create functional prototypes, that can be handed over to development teams
				for taking to production.
			</p>
			<p>Most experienced designers have their own component libraries, or prefer using some. Most beginners benefit from using
				component libraries (like bootstrap, polymer, telerik).
			</p>
			<p> As the web components revolution gets more traction, libraries of web components will rise. The atom project tools let
				designers work with any of these web components or their own to create prototypes.
				<p><i> (Side note: Currently our tools don’t support “Hi-Fidelity” prototyping in a way that
				most people use the term. So you can’t animate objects with cool effects, but you can populate a responsive data grid
				with real data from a url or API.)</i></p>
			</p>

			<h2>Developers
			</h2>
			<p>In our interviews with several developers we see a common theme emerging — prototyping tools don’t output code that is
				usable by a developer. Thats why we have carefully crafted the developer experience for the atom project tools and infrastructure.
				For all building blocks used in prototyping, we leverage the web component spec. Our tools take care of integrating with
				popular build systems and package managers. All output coming from our prototyping tools is HTML so you can work with
				it the way you want. Since our tooling is open-source, you can tweak it to get the type of output markup that you need.
				We try to create our tools in a way that even after developers start working with the code, when the designers need to
				make small edits using the prototyping interface, they are able to do so.
			</p>

			<h2>Students
			</h2>
			<p>We are very excited to work with students, from disciplines like engineering and design. (We welcome students from other
				disciplines as well). The atom project tools enable students to craft their ideas into meaningful working prototypes
				in a few minutes. We are working with student communities to create examples of use cases to demonstrate how many undergraduate
				final year projects can be built in an hour or less. The idea is to provide students with tools to rapidly experiment
				with data, statistical models, information visualisations, connected devices, the physical web, IOT, user interfaces
				and experiences.
			</p>

			<h2>Educators</h2>

			<p>The tools that the atom project provides to your students are the same that industry professionals are using for large
				and complex projects. This helps create early exposure and get students industry ready. We want to help reduce the industry-academia
				gap. We are thrilled to work with your school or university. We can come in and organise an interactive hands-on session
				for students or have them visit a professional environment. Students can see the atom project tools in action, learn
				about the power of prototyping and get introduced to the world of progressive web apps.</p>
