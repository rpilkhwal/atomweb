			<p> To create our ecosystem of tools we follow a few key tenets — leveraging web standards, integrating with others, and being
				open.
			</p>
			<h2>Web Standards
			</h2>
			<p>
				We love to leverage web standards because they provide a very robust foundation for our ambitious goals. They give us the
				power to operate with and in any technology framework, language or platform of choice. We also believe in community driven
				approaches and feel that the way web standards evolve beautifully demonstrate that spirit.
			</p>

			<h2>Integrations
			</h2>
			<p>
				We integrate with others because it lets us focus on fewer things and execute them better. We realise that certain web based
				tools are already providing good mechanisms to work with aspects of web applications and see no sense in reinventing
				the wheel. We respect the work that creators of these tools have put in and like to collaborate and co-create rather
				than compete.
			</p>
			<h1>Openness Considerations
			</h1>
			<h2>Can I work with my own elements?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes, you can use your own elements in the element browser, form and page builders, together with those provided by the atom
				project. Simply upload or link to your own elements; any valid web component will do. Since form elements are a special
				class of elements (they have common patterns like labels, inputs, errors etc.) you will need to mark these bits out to
				take full advantage of the form builder.
			</p>
			<h2>Must I use all of atoms tools?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Not necessarily. The various elements and tools are designed to work independently of each other. Based on your requirement
				you might want to use only the form builder or the page builder or the API calling interface. These tools work well together,
				but you are free to use any tool of your choice, or write custom code for any part of the web app creation process and
				use the atom project tools for other parts.
			</p>
			<h2>Developer workflow concerns
			</h2>
			<p>
				Just like using a tool such as Sublime Text for writing code does not impose any proprietary constraints on developers, using
				the atom project’s form or page builder does not constrain the development workflow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some people would like to code in notepad, or notepad++, while others may prefer Sublime Text or Visual Studio. Similarly
				some people might be more comfortable hand coding forms or pages, while others may like to leverage tools like the form
				&amp; page builder.
			</p>
			<p>
				Code generated using the form or page builder would be pure HTML with no proprietary strings attached.
			</p>
			<h2>User data concerns
			</h2>
			<p>
				We believe in helping you to shape and bring your ideas to life. Everything you create is yours — you retain rights to all
				work created by you, and at all times you retain a copy of your data.
			</p>
