			<h1>Democratize creation.</h1>
			<h2>Human</h2>

			<p>Empower people to become creators rather than just consumers. Of technology, and all the benefits and possibilities that
				it enables.</p>

			<p>A lot of people have ideas about how to solve everyday problems using technology, but are limited because complexities
				of implementation get in the way. We aim to abstract that complexity away so that people can focus on solving problems.</p>

			<p>We use the term ‘solving problems’ in a broad sense. It could mean things like <a href="http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html" target="__blank">create awareness</a>, <a href="http://androidforacademics.com/attendance/" target="__blank">ask questions</a>, <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/in_the_newsroom_1.html" target="__blank">tell stories</a>,
				<a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/indian-students-create-earphones-that-can-detect-pain-send-sos/articleshow/55149758.cms" target="__blank">solve problems</a>. </p>
			<h2>Machine</h2>

			<p>The future lies in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/523666/software-that-augments-human-thinking/" target="__blank">human machine symbiosis</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgVdr_W-7Wo" target="__blank">democratising the process of creation</a>.</p>

			<p>It also lies in automating creation of forms, pages, <a href="https://thegrid.io/" target="__blank">sites</a>, data sources, apps and much more.</p>

			<p>Design thinking and co-creation today are about working with other people to generate, improve and implement ideas. In
				the future it will be about working with people and AI to co-create. We will need tools which allow, nay, advance such
				interactions.</p>
