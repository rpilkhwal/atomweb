			<h1>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….</h1>


			<h2>Chapter 1. Humble Beginnings</h2>
			<p>An epic battle raged between UX designers and front-end developers. There was constant tension since the developers demanded
				frozen specs and interoperable frameworks while the designers needed to keep evolving products based on user testing
				and new learnings. While agile methodologies provided some relief, the hunt was on for a new kind of technology. One
				that could broker peace between these clans by helping to streamline UI development and maintenance workflow…
			</p>

			<h2>Chapter 2. Era of Exploration</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile, a new force called web components was maturing which promised powers like being able to create custom html
				elements that could encapsulate styles and functionality. As these designers and developers started exploring this technology,
				they realised its revolutionary potential. Living style guides took on a whole new meaning and significant improvement
				was made in their component driven UI workflow…
			</p>
			<h2>Chapter 3. Using the Force</h2>
			<p>The component driven development challenge was now solved to a great degree. However, a group of inspired Jedi weren’t
				satisfied yet and wondered what more they could achieve using this force. So they started applying thought towards streamlining
				and automating processes of putting components together to create interface pieces like forms and pages. They also wanted
				to leverage dynamic data from external sources in the interfaces that were being prototyped using tools they created…
			</p>
			<h2>Chapter 4. Empowering the galaxy</h2>
			<p>As these Jedi experienced the power of using the force, they felt that its true impact would be realised if they could
				empower a much larger set of people to use the web component force and meaningfully benefit from it. They started developing
				ideas around democratising the process of creation by providing easy tools to make powerful technology accessible to
				people outside the developer &amp; tech community as well. Hence effort started concentrating on making these prototyping
				tools delightfully usable by people with basic skills, e.g. those who could use productivity software like google mail
				or docs…

			<h2>Chapter 5. Today (the atom project)</h2>
			<p>
				The result of these endeavours is the atom project.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Chapter 6. The Future</h2>
			<p>
				Our community continues to grow, and our story gets more interesting with your love, support and contributions. We are always
				experimenting with newer ideas while remaining focussed towards our vision.
