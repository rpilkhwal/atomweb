		<div>
			<p>We believe that by breaking down the various dimensions of modern web applications, we can arrive at a set of different
				aspects, each of which a dedicated tool can help to work with.</p>

			<h2>Aspect 1: User input</h2>

			<p>For instance, most applications require user input. More often than not, this input is captured using a form. People with
				web development experience know that creating good forms is no trivial task. Hence, having a dedicated tool like a form
				builder to expedite and ease the process of creating good forms seems like a good idea. </p>

			<p> <i>(Side note: Think about creating hundreds of forms containing thousands of form elements across your applications. Also
				think about the possibility of not spending a single developer minute on tasks that business analysts or designers can
				tackle without coding— like creating form front ends and basic logic.)
			</i></p>
			<p>
				<i>(Caveat: Some experienced web developers may like to work free from constraining frameworks. We get that. However, they
				still work with some rules of their own; and an open-source form builder lets them modify the rules and the kind of markup
				that the form builder outputs.)</i>
			</p>
			<h2>Aspect 2: Output to the user (or data display)</h2>

			<p>Every site or application has one or more pages where data is displayed for users to view and consume or interact with.
				Most applications have simple layouts to display items on a page. We place elements side by side and one below the other
				(think dashboard, report, landing page). On mobile devices, all elements stack one below the other. Of course, this is
				an oversimplification, but it is good enough for most cases. Hence, similar to the form builder example, having a dedicated
				tool like a page builder to place objects on a page would seem useful.</p>

			<p>
				<i>
				(Side note: Apps driven by voice based UIs may not have “pages”. Similarly, as newer forms of interaction gain adoption,
				reliance on traditional forms may reduce. e.g. think how mass adoption of brain computer interfaces may affect your apps.
				But for the foreseeable future, page based metaphors for information display are here to stay.)
			</i></p>
			<p>
				<i>	 (Caveat: Page builder
				is not to be confused with widget builder. It is not intended to be used as a freeform design tool. Its purpose is simply
				to place and rearrange high-level blocks on a page. This keeps the tool’s usage simple and doesn’t overload it.)
